                                          can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring
                                          companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or
                                          other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any
                                          material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will
                                          support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to
                                          a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a
                                          residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you
                                          remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home.
                                          While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided
                                          the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in goodstanding
                                          with your temple.
