
A tool for building a level 1 character utilizing the free standard materials supplied by Wizards of the Coast for
the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons TTRPG. Utilizing the SRD materials only, this application should step the user
through the process of character generation.

This process (and this is subject to change) should generally go like this:

1) Pass in [name], [race], and [class] parameters for your character
2) Based on [race] and [class] selections, user will be prompted for input regarding languages, proficiencies, etc
3) Character sheet will display

Long term goal:
Establish this as backend logic that can be "plugged-in" to a frontend interface such as a GUI
