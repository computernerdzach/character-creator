A tool for building a level 1 character utilizing the free standard materials supplied by Wizards of the Coast for
the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons TTRPG. Utilizing the SRD materials only, this application should step the user
through the process of character generation.

This process (and this is subject to change) should generally go like this:

* Name Character - generalized class
    - name is passed down from general class into race

* Select Character Race
    - racial attributes established
        ~ some proficiencies will need to be selected
    - race attributes are passed down from a racial class into character_class.

* Select Character Class
    - job attributes are established
        ~ some selections (such as weapons and tools) may need to be selected
    - job (class) attributes are passed down from job class into background class.

* Select Character Background
    - background attributes established
        ~ some selections like background items may need to be selected

* generate and assign stats

* Read out and access of character details
